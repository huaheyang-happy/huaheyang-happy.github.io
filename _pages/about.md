I am currently an undergraduate in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/) at Nankai University. I will be pursuing my PhD degree under the supervision of [Prof. Shengquan Chen](https://my.nankai.edu.cn/sms/csq/list.htm).  My research focuses on developing machine learning methods to uncover transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and their dynamic changes along aging and various single-cell omics problems. Specifically, I am interested in:

- **Deciphering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.** Transcriptional regulation is a central process in biological systems. I interested in developing methods to model transcriptional regulatory networks leveraging single-cell multi-omics data.
- **Identifying the dynamic changes during the aging process.** Aging is a fundamental biological process driving functional decline and numerous diseases. I am interested in leveraging single-cell multi-omics data to identify and model the cellular dynamics that characterize the aging trajectory.
- **Cell type-specific pattern elucidation.** I am interested in exploring cellular heterogeneity and biological implications in single-cell omics data, such as cell type annotation, multi-omics data integration, batch correction, cell type specific feature identication and label transfer problem.
